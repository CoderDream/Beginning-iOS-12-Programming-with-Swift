## Customize Table View Cells

- Let's first change the style of the cell. You can't customize the cell when it's set to the *Basic* style. Select the prototype cell and change the style from Basic to *Custom* in the Attributes inspector(把单元格的样式改为自定义)


Next, we will add three labels to the prototype cell:  - Name - for restaurant name  - Location - for restaurant location (e.g. New York)  - Type - for restaurant type (e.g. tea house)  
To add a label, drag a Label object from the Object library to the cell. Name the first label *Name*. Instead of using the system font for the label, we'll use a text style. I will explain to you the difference of a fixed font and a text style in later chapters. For now, just go to the Attributes inspector, and change the font to *Text Styles - Headline* . To change the font to the Headline style, click the *T* button of the font option and change the font from *System to Headline*.Drag another label to the cell and name it Location. Change the font to *Text Styles-Subhead* and set the font color to *Dark Gray* . Lastly, create another label and name it Type. Similarly, change the font style to *Text Styles- Subhead* and set the font color to *Dark Gray* .
